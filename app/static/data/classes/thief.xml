    <description><![CDATA[<p>You've heard them, sitting around the campfire. Bragging about this battle or that. About how their gods are smiling on your merry band. You count your coins and smile to yourself - this is the thrill above all. You alone know the secret of Dungeon World - filthy filthy lucre.</p><p>Sure, they give you lip for all the times you've snuck off alone but without you, who among them wouldn't have been dissected by a flying guillotine or poisoned straight to death by some ancient needle trap? So, let them complain. When you're done with all this delving you'll toast their hero's graves.</p><p>From your castle. Full of gold. You rogue.</p>]]></description>
